# IPL Score Predictor (1st Innings)

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that predicts the expected first-innings score in an IPL match based on user inputs like venue, batting team, bowling team, and overs played.

The machine learning model for this predictor was trained and optimized separately (not included in this repository). This repo is focused purely on the **Streamlit deployment** of the already-trained model for user interaction and live predictions.
