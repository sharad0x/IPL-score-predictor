# IPL Score Predictor (1st Innings)

This project is a **Streamlit-based web application** that predicts the expected first-innings score in an IPL match based on user inputs like venue, batting team, bowling team, and overs played.

The machine learning model for this predictor was trained and optimized separately (not included in this repository). This repo is focused purely on the **Streamlit deployment** of the already-trained model for user interaction and live predictions.

## Example

For illustration, consider the above match scenario:

- **Match**: RCB vs PBKS, held in Ahmedabad  
- **Batting**: RCB (first innings)  
- **Overs completed**: 8  
- **Current score**: 69 runs for 2 wickets  
- **Last 5 overs runs**: 9, 7, 9, 6, 8 (total 39 runs)

Feeding these details into the model predicted a first-innings total in the range of **184â€“194 runs**. The actual final first-innings score turned out to be **190 runs for 9 wickets**, demonstrating good predictive performance with approximately 96% accuracy.
